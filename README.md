# Introduction
Data Wrangling is a core skill for any Data Analyst. In this project I used the common techniques for Data Wrangling on a live case. I had a twitter account [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) that initiaed the '#WeRateDogs' in 2015. You simply send them a picture of your dog with its name, they rate it and repost the image with the dog name and given rating.
# Motivation
The project's given was the account's archive, JSON file to be pulled by twitter's API and a dog breed prediction results dataset of a neural network machine. 
# Working details
I used the given datasets to **Gather**, **Assess**, and **Clean** these datasets. Using the common techniques learnet and more, I managed to successfully have a complete and reliable dataset ready for Analysis.
# Main output contents
* wrangle_act.ipynb
* act_report.docx
* act_report.pdf
* rate_your_dog.sqlite
* twitter_archive_master.csv

# Main Challenge
I could not run the twitter API as I could not get my Twiter developer's user account in time, I opted for the txt file for now and will run it in a later notebook.
